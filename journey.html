        <p>My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florence-mary/">LinkedIn</a> page is a bit stuffed so here's a
            summary of what I've been up to until now (although LinkedIn is still the go-to page for detailed
            experience).</p>
        <p><strong>I didn't include my experience as a Web Writer (since 2008) as it's my current focus, and it's
            better described in my <a href="now.html">/now</a> page</strong></p>

        <section class="one-job">
            <h2>Software Engineering</h2>

            <p>From January 2020 up to February 2025, I was a Software Engineer. I've worked in three different
                companies,
                first as a consultant (first company), then as an internal developer. I liked coding for the
                intellectual
                challenges it brought. I was lucky to work for two companies developing software for pharmaceuticals and
                medical applications, which was fascinating and fed my curiosity.</p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to be the Lead Developer on a 6-month project and to take over more than the coding
                part of the project, which was a blessing (I loved it) but also a curse (after that, being back as
                "just" a
                developer didn't feel enough anymore).</p>
            <p>I spent my last year in a Data Warehouse team and enjoyed figuring what data engineering actually meant.
                But
                to be honest, I never developed a passion for ETL, and the technical environment wasn't satisfying for
                me.</p>
            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I've always been the go-to person for any task involving writing, and even took initiatives like
                    improving
                    internal documentation or creating a body of knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>I have a passion for knowledge sharing and led campaigns in my teams to improve it.</li>
                <li>I was eager to learn more than coding. Although I prefer backend development, I made a lot of
                    research
                    in
                    order to improve the user experience and the accessibility of our apps, also trying to raise
                    awareness
                    among
                    my coworkers.
                </li>
                <li>I was really interested in CI/CD, automation and the "ops" of DevOps. I don't consider myself
                    proficient
                    in
                    those parts, but I'm quite knowledgeable.
                </li>
                <li>I took additional, non-technical responsibilities, like being Scrum Master, or
                    kind-of-Product-Owner, on
                    projects where there was no such position.
                </li>

            <h2>Collective Intelligence</h2>

            <p>At my latest company, I had the opportunity to attend a training, certify as a facilitator and practice
                Collective Intelligence, aside from my Software Engineering job (approx. 10% of my time). From December
                2022
                to February 2025, I facilitated workshops for different teams in the company. I designed the workshops
                based
                on the request, animated the session and worked on the follow-up (gathering output).</p>
            <p>I also actively participated in creating a body of knowledge that could be share company-wide, creating
                training material for managers and teams who wanted to learn how to practice Collective Intelligence and
                facilitated hands-on workshops.</p>
            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>My certification report was about the link between Collective Intelligence and DEI (Diversity,
                    Equity
                    and
                    Inclusion), and how they influence each other.
                </li>

            <h2>Speaker on Minimalism and Decluttering</h2>
            <p>During my career break, while I was working on my transition from administrative roles to the job of
                Software
                Engineer, I took the opportunity to develop some freelance activities. My most successful activity was
                giving workshops and conferences about minimalism, that is "how to declutter", "how to better consume"
                (durability, ethics...) and so on.</p>
            <p>I usually organized those myself, but I was asked a few times to give such workshops to members of an
                organisation or company.</p>
            <p>This is also the moment I took time to write my self-help books and online trainings on decluttering.</p>

        <section class="one-job">
            <h2>Administrative assistant</h2>
            <p>I started my career with a degree of "Management assistant". I worked at three different places and
                always
                held "Swiss knife" positions where I could use multiple talents in one role. I had the opportunity to
                work
                in Marketing, Medical, HR, Logistics and Sales. I enjoyed the organisational part of those jobs, and
                learned
                a lot about company dynamics, as I worked at very different types of structures, in various fields.</p>
            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I put in place a system to follow up the 650 staff members of an organization to make sure they all
                    received
                    their invitation to the annual medical exam on time, and to follow-up no-shows.
                </li>
                <li>I wrote a monthly B2B newsletter (French and English), translated marketing and technical content
                    into
                    English or proofread them (technical FAQs, packaging, SEO keywords, video subtitles, newsletters,
                    leaflets...).
                </li>
                <li>I created a whole brochure for a product launch with InDesign and received a company recognition for
                    it.
                    (It's worth mentioning I wouldn't be able to use that software anymore.)
                </li>
                <li>I wrote working procedures for the whole logistics department based on individual interviews (French
                    and
                    English).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bachelor degree in Business Informatics ("information de gestion"), and many trainings and
                certifications in
                addition.
            </li>
            <li>Bachelor degree as a Management Assistant, with focus on languages (Dutch, English, Spanish). Internship
                in
                The Netherlands (4 months) and graduation work in Dutch about "Intercultural communication".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong interest in DEI and accessibility: I participated in initiatives for inclusion whenever I had the
                opportunity. I also regularly train on this topic and am especially interested in the inclusion of women
                and
                neurodivergent people.
            </li>
            <li>Passion for knowledge sharing: apart from initiatives at work, I was involved in mentoring programs as a
                volunteer.
            </li>
            <li>My mother tongue is French and, as a language lover and writer, I'm pretty good at it. I have a C2 level
                in
                English (I hope it shows...). I'm learning Japanese, I passed the JLPT N4 exam but am probably still far
                from the N3 level. I used to be very skilled in Dutch and used it for years at work, but haven't spoken
                it
                for ages. However, I can still understand podcasts in clean Dutch (I mean, not Flemish nor local
                dialects)
                or read news. I also studied Spanish but have never actually used it outside of school (or during my
                very
                few trips to Spain).
            </li>
        </ul>
