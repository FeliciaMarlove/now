    <h1>Why I decided to create a /now page</h1>
    <p class="page-description">Welcome to Florence Mary's /now page. Here's where I explain why I need a /now page.</p>

        <p>I'm probably what you could call a slasher, or to use fancier and more recent terms, I have a "portfolio
            career", or a "professional constellation". It means I have a hard time choosing only one activity because
            I'm interested in too many things, I have a creative mind that won't shut down and I can't help building new
            projects in my imagination that I crave to implement afterward.</p>
        <p>I've tried for a long time to fight the urge and stick to a single activity or project at a time, but I've
            come to the realization that it wasn't the model that suit me, and that following "everyone's" way of doing
            things didn't make me happy.</p>
        <p>So here I am, trying to create my own constellation (it's nothing esoteric, it only means I'm choosing the
            different projects and activities that fit in my portfolio and making connections between them) in order to
            satisfy my cravings.</p>
        <p>However, I noticed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florence-mary">LinkedIn</a> is really not a good
            platform to display a multifaceted career, and I guess it's a nightmare trying to figure out who I am and
            what I do.</p>
        <p>That's where the /now page comes in handy. By the way, <a href="https://nownownow.com/">I didn't invent the
            concept of the /now page</a>.</p>
        <p>I hope my /now page allows people (recruiters, clients, stalkers...) to understand <strong>what I'm currently
            available for and what's my focus at the moment</strong>, without going through my 16 years of varied
            professional experience and my 22 certifications (not kidding) on LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>I get that experience is useful to understand one's situation, that's why my /now page comes with a
            summary of <a href="journey.html">my journey</a>, in a condensed format.</p>
