        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>I'm mainly writing at the moment</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'm currently taking a break from being a salary woman to work on several personal and professional
            projects.</p>
        <p>On professional grounds, I'd like to redefine my way of working, reshape my career in IT and find
            professional opportunities in writing.</p>
        <p>On the personal side, I plan to work on my garden to create a haven for bees and butterflies (and all the
            other creatures that are less attractive but still deserve to live), read a lot of books, be more consistent
            in my yoga and pilates practice, and in my study of Japanese, and improve my drawing skills so I can
            illustrate my travel diaries. And many other things.</p>


        <h2>Priority project</h2>
        Finishing my new novel (French). First draft is done, now I'm reading it again and again to make it even better.

        <h2>Sides</h2>
        Those are projects that I'm building on the side when not busy with my priority project, and that will probably
        become my next "priority projects" when the current one is done.

            <h3>French comprehensible input for learners</h3>
            <h4>Why I'm doing this</h4>
            I have a passion for knowledge sharing and I love learning new languages. I've been learning Japanese by
            myself for a few years now, and after hitting a plateau, I found motivation again thanks to the
            "comprehensible input" method. I combined my passions for language learning and knowledge sharing with my
            writing skills to offer the same experience to French learners.

            <h4>What I'm actually doing</h4>
            <p><strong>Lis et écris en français !</strong> (French/English) - I'm publishing content for French learners
                to help them improve their reading and writing skills in particular. I'm not writing lessons, but
                instead give advice on how to practice French without studying with the <a
                        href="https://feliciamarlove.substack.com/p/french-comprehensible-input-ba5">"comprehensible
                    input" aka "language acquisition" method</a>. </p>
            <p>Here are my current inititiatives:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainly busy building a community and trying different ideas to find how I can actually help
                    French learners using this method.</strong></li>
                <li>I'm sharing advice on how to use the "comprehensible input" method to learn French on my website <a
                        href="https://lis-et-ecris-en-francais.fr/">"Lis et écris en français !"</a>.
                </li>
                <li>I'm writing a <a href="https://feliciamarlove.substack.com/">"personal journal" kind of publication
                    on
                    Substack</a> to share weekly short, funny (I'm trying at least) stories that French learners can use
                    to
                    practice reading in French. I try to come with interesting insight about the language with each
                    story.
                </li>
                <li>I chose to only use <a
                        href="https://fr.pinterest.com/theflonicles/french-comprehensible-input-learning-french/">Pinterest</a>
                    as a social network to increase visibility, as I now refuse to use any media owned by Meta or X.
                    Being
                    active on Pinterest motivates me to create more visual content for my posts, which in turn improves
                    visibility on search engines, so it's a win-win situation.
                </li>
                <li>I'm giving <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Frenchinput/">Reddit</a> a try. I'm actively answering
                    questions from French learners on existing subs, and created my own (not yet very active). Although
                    the
                    community is not growing yet, this Reddit sub increased my visibility, as I gained subscribers and
                    visitors directly from it.
                </li>
                <li>I wrote one <a href="https://feliciamarlove.substack.com/p/livre-complet-french-comprehensible">long-form
                    content (ebook)</a>, as one of my end goals is to publish more of that kind of content. Before
                    spending
                    time on all my ebooks ideas, I created a first one to check if people are interested in this format
                    and
                    in hope to receive some feedback to improve the next ones.

            <h3>Writing about minimalism, decluttering, slow living, feminism, travel (French/English)</h3>
            <h4>Why I'm doing this</h4>
            This blog has been out there since 2008 and evolved with me to become what it is today. This is where I
            share other passions of mine that are more on the "lifestyle" side.

            <h4>What I'm actually doing</h4>
            <p><strong>The Flonicles</strong> is primarily <a href="https://www.theflonicles.be/">a blog</a>, but I also
                publish guides (ebooks or paper books) on how to declutter or how to organize and simplify the everyday
                life. Recently, I moved my newsletter from Mailchimp to <a href="https://theflonicles.substack.com/">Substack</a>,
                where I allow myself to write freely and with few rules (little care for SEO, not trying to stick to
                limited topics...). I also decided to move all my efforts on social media to <a
                        href="https://www.pinterest.com/theflonicles/">Pinterest</a> and not even bother with Meta
                medias anymore.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improve blog posts and refreshing content, both on the SEO and content side. I'm currently
                    going
                    through all my posts, reading them and making them better</strong></li>
                <li>As I decided to invest time in Pinterest, I'm creating more illustrations for my articles.</li>
                <li>I'm translating my articles into English. I don't know if I'll translate all 100 posts I've already
                    written in French, but I'm at least doing it for popular articles and my travel diaries.
                </li>
                <li>Reworking the general website look and feel.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>On hiatus</h2>
        <p>I started writing <a href="https://thecodeshewrites.com/">The Code She Writes</a> (English) when I changed career in
            2020 (from a former 10-years administrative assistant career to working as a developer). That blog had a
            double-purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Learn by teaching": there's evidence that explaining things to others helps improve one's knowledge and
                notice gaps (cfr the Feynman technique for example).
            </li>
            <li>Be a "woman in tech": as there is an under-representation of women in tech fields, I wanted to have a
                public visibility as a woman shifting to a career in IT.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Also, it helps me find information I've previously seen without going through my favorite links, my Trello
            boards, my notebooks and so on.)</p>
        <p>It's currently on a hiatus, but I still have ideas for it. To be even more transparent, I'm currently
            figuring
            out how I'm going to reshape my career in IT, and this blog will be my portfolio. So, before I start
            reworking it, I have to define a clear plan for myself!</p>
